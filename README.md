# Rag-pipeline-LLM-Langchain-
An end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain, Qdrant, Sentence Transformers, and LLaMA 3.2. This app allows you to upload any PDF, convert its content into vector embeddings, store them in a local Qdrant database, and ask context-aware questions powered by LLMs â€” all with a simple Gradio interface.
